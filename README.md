## Background

The mission of the [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/) (CoE), housed within the [General Services Administration](https://gsa.gov) (GSA), is to accelerate Information Technology (IT) modernization, improve the public experience, and reduce legacy IT spending across the Government. CoE accomplishes this by centralizing top government tech talent, leveraging private-sector best practices, and operating with a teaming mindset across Government departments and agencies. To better align with the dynamic effects of such a transformation, CoE provides agency partners with a shared service solution for professional services.

At the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/) (HUD), the Data Analytics CoE was tasked to define the analytics outcomes and priorities while assessing existing data, tools, and systems used by HUD programs and offices. HUD also desired the development of a strategy for analytics transformation that includes data governance, data management, and use cases for artificial intelligence technologies.

## Purpose

HUD has a need to create data visualizations that increase financial transparency and program effectiveness within HUD by connecting program, financial, and human capital information (e.g., salary and expenditure information). The team performing this work must create dashboards that provide the information HUD stakeholders need to incorporate in their data-driven decision making process with near-real time, mobile available, and access-controlled visualizations.

This will be done based on the development of prototypes drawn from program requirements that will then be operationalized. Once operationalized, this team must also develop data documentation and training relevant to the dashboards created.
